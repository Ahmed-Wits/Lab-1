# Lab 1 Report: Git and GitHub

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, including repository initialization, committing changes, managing branches, and deploying a web page to GitHub Pages.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Git Repository Initialization:**
   - I initialized a Git repository and created the necessary files (`index.html`, `student-info.txt`, and `report.md`).
   - I successfully made an initial commit with the required files.

2. **Branching and Commits:**
   - I created a feature branch (`feature/student-details`) and added a short bio to the `index.html` file.
   - I committed the changes to the feature branch and merged it back into the `master` branch.

3. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - I created a repository on GitHub and linked it to my local repository.
   - I pushed my code to GitHub and successfully enabled GitHub Pages to deploy the `index.html` file.

## Challenges Encountered

- Initially, I encountered issues with authentication when pushing to GitHub. I resolved it by generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) and later switched to SSH for a more secure, password-less setup.

## Conclusion

This lab helped me understand the basic workflows involved in using Git and GitHub, as well as deploying a simple webpage to GitHub Pages. I now have a better understanding of version control, branching, and collaboration.
